<h1>Enterprie Serial Bus 1.1 Usable User is now available in the Alpha version.</h1>

<p>Theoretically, we have to write tests for selected controllers, but you can already use Api version 1.1 Alpha. Api is based on the basic assumptions of reactive programming, such as the use of actors from the Akka package. We invite you to test and submit comments and transfer donations. If the subsidies exceed 5,000 usd, we will go fully on Fast Data.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><code>git clone https://github.com/silenceonthewire/com.silenceonthewire.esb.git</code>
<code>cd com.silenceonthewire.esb</code></p>
<ode>sbt run&lt;/code&gt;

<h2>How to use this version?</h2>

<h3>Companies actions</h3>

<p>While working on our api, we assumed that to create a user, you have to create at least one company. Therefore, as the first element we explain activities on companies.</p>

<h4>Add new company</h4>

<p>There is a newCompany.json file in the com.silenceonthewire.esb/test-data/company directory. This file is sent to the server by the command:</p>

<code>curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @W katalogu newCompany.json http://localhost:9000/api/v1/users/company/add</code>

<p>And we get the answer:</p>

<code>{"id": 1522759308539, "createdAt": 1522759308539, "updatedAt": 1522759308539, "name": "Example Company", "phone": "123456789", "taxNumber": "1234567890", "email": "company @ example.com "," address ":" street 1 "," city ":" city "," state ":" state "," country ":" country "," postalCode ":" 11-111 "," users "[]}</code>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>As I have already mentioned, we will reach the full Fast Data if the amount of your shares exceeds 5,000 usd. Then we'll break into Apache Kafka and Cassandra's base.</p>

<p>Additionally, remember that you can already post orders related to FastData, I am more interested in freelancing than full-time job. Calculations using artificial intelligence? There is no welding. Rewriting the existing application interface to something deadly fast is also not a problem.</p>

<p>What's next with this project? First of all, I want to stabilize all available api this week. And then I want to write files management with the OCR system, so I can not do without Tesserac and Elastic Search. Greetings and look forward to the news.</p>
