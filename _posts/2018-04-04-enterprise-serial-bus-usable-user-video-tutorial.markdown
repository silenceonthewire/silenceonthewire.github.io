<h1>Enterprie Serial Bus 1.1 Usable User video tutorials</h1>

<h2>CompanyApi ESB v.1.1 Usable Users Company api</h2>

<p>While working on our api, we assumed that to create a user, you have to create at least one company. Therefore, as the first element we explain activities on companies.</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>

<p>As I have already mentioned, we will reach the full Fast Data if the amount of your shares exceeds 5,000 usd. Then we'll break into Apache Kafka and Cassandra's base.</p>

<p>Additionally, remember that you can already post orders related to FastData, I am more interested in freelancing than full-time job. Calculations using artificial intelligence? There is no welding. Rewriting the existing application interface to something deadly fast is also not a problem.</p>

<p>What's next with this project? First of all, I want to stabilize all available api this week. And then I want to write files management with the OCR system, so I can not do without Tesserac and Elastic Search. Greetings and look forward to the news.</p>
