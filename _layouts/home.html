            <p class="light">We chose Extreme Programming as the main process. It is based on communication, simplicity, feedback (from the client) and mutual support of the team. The team consists of both programmers and the future user (but not the sponsor). This process is focused on the quick delivery of the product as simple as possible. It is based on full integration of the team, communication, interactive analysis and design process. Our prototypes focus on the design and design of the system, on the use of technology, not on its appearance. This solution allows you to instantly provide solutions that you can choose for yourself.</p>

            <p class="light">Microservice architecture is most often used for large, complex and complex IT systems requiring multi-directional development. Independent applications that support specific departments, functions or business processes operate within one integrated system. Micro-services are independent of each other in business and technology, thanks to which they can be developed in parallel by various project teams. In order to introduce a new function in one area, there is no need for changes in other areas, and possible problems resulting from the development of individual modules do not cause disruptions in the operation of the entire system.</p>

            <p class="light">All our projects contain what is called 5V, i.e. volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. Large data sets bring great benefits especially in the case of rapidly changing business processes. However, most of the information loses its operational value in a short time. To extract the maximum of knowledge from very dynamically changing data, you need to analyze it very quickly and use IT tools that enable it. You can say that the right data at the right time is Big Data in real time, meaning Fast Data. Fast data is not a monolithic technology or a specific solution. It consists of a whole spectrum of different technologies.</p>
